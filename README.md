# CS 340: Animal Rescue Operations Dashboard
This repo includes the final version of the dashboard I built for Grazioso Salvare, a fictional animal rescue company. It connects to a MongoDB database using a Python-based CRUD module I created earlier in the course.

### 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To keep my code clean and adaptable, I use clear variable and function names, keep things organized, and add comments where it counts. For this project, the CRUD module I built earlier made it easy to plug into the dashboard without redoing the logic. That really helped keep things modular and easy to test or reuse. I could use this CRUD setup in future database projects just by swapping out the collections or changing up the query details.

### 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I try to break the problem down and focus on what the user actually needs. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I looked at what kind of animal data they needed to track—location, training status, availability—and then worked backwards to design a database that fit. Compared to older assignments, this one felt more like working with a real-world client. It pushed me to think more about usability, not just functionality. For future projects, I’d keep starting with user needs first, then build out the database and code structure from there.

### 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists build tools that solve real problems. We take all the moving parts—data, logic, design—and make something that actually works in the real world. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, this dashboard helps them keep all their important data in one place and makes their day-to-day work easier and more organized. It's a small example, but it shows how tech can make a real difference when it’s built with a clear purpose.
